# OP11: Distribution of observation period end dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for observation period end dates (observation_period_end_date) across all observation period records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query
```sql
WITH op AS
  (SELECT
      cast(observation_period_end_date - '1900-01-01'::date as integer) diffs,
      CAST(TO_CHAR(observation_period_end_date,'YYYYMMDD') AS INTEGER) AS end_date,
	  COUNT(*) OVER() AS population_size
   FROM @cdm.observation_period
  )
SELECT
MIN(end_date) AS min_end_date,
max(end_date) AS max_end_date,
 '1900-01-01'::date + make_interval(days => ROUND(AVG(diffs),0)::integer) AS avg_end_date,
  round( STDDEV( end_date ), 1 )                                                                                      AS STDEV_days ,
CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR)  AS percentile_25,
 CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR)  AS median_value,
CAST(MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN 9999999999 ELSE end_date END) AS VARCHAR)  AS percentile_75

FROM
 ( SELECT
     diffs,
	 end_date                                                     AS end_date,
     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY end_date)                        AS order_nr,
     population_size
   FROM op
 ) ordered_data;
```

## Input

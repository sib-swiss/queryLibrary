SELECT ce.condition_concept_id, c.concept_name, COUNT(*) AS records_count
  FROM @cdm.condition_era ce
  JOIN @vocab.concept c
    ON c.concept_id = ce.condition_concept_id
  WHERE ((select count(1) from parms) = 0 or ce.condition_concept_id in  (select cid from parms) )
 GROUP BY ce.condition_concept_id, c.concept_name
 ORDER BY records_count DESC;

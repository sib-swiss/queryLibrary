# CE12: Distribution of condition era start dates

## Description
This query is used to to provide summary statistics for condition era start dates (condition_era_start_date) across all condition era records: the mean, the standard deviation, the minimum, the 25th percentile, the median, the 75th percentile, the maximum and the number of missing values. No input is required for this query.

## Query

```sql
WITH ordered_data AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       condition_era_start_date,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY condition_concept_id ORDER BY condition_era_start_date) order_nr,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY condition_concept_id) AS population_size
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
), percentiles AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .25 * population_size THEN MAKE_DATE(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_start_date END) AS pct_25,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .50 * population_size THEN MAKE_DATE(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_start_date END) AS median,
       MIN(CASE WHEN order_nr < .75 * population_size THEN MAKE_DATE(9999,1,1) ELSE condition_era_start_date END) AS pct_75
  FROM ordered_data
 GROUP BY condition_concept_id
), aggregates AS (
SELECT condition_concept_id,
       MIN(condition_era_start_date) AS min_start_date,
       MAX(condition_era_start_date) AS max_start_date,
       CAST(AVG(CAST(condition_era_end_date - MAKE_DATE(1,1,1) AS NUMERIC)) AS INTEGER) + MAKE_DATE(1,1,1) AS avg_end_date,
       ROUND(STDDEV(CAST(condition_era_end_date- MAKE_DATE(1,1,1) AS NUMERIC)),0) AS std_dev_days
  FROM @cdm.condition_era
 GROUP BY condition_concept_id
 )
 SELECT a.*, p.*
   FROM aggregates a
   JOIN percentiles p
     ON a.condition_concept_id = p.condition_concept_id
  ORDER BY a.condition_concept_id;
```
## Input

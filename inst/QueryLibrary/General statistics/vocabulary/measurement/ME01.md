count(distinct person_id)::integer as n_individuals, round(avg(followup_points)) as mean_followup_points, round(avg(followup_days)) as mean_followup_days      
 from
	(select person_id, measurement_concept_id, unit_concept_id, count(distinct measurement_date) as followup_points,
	 max(measurement_date) - min(measurement_date) as followup_days  from measurement
	 where measurement_concept_id > 0
	group by person_id, measurement_concept_id, unit_concept_id
	having count(*)  > 2) m

# G02: Find a concept by code from a source vocabulary

This query obtains the concept details associated with a concept code, such as name, class, level and source vocabulary.

Only concepts from the Standard Vocabularies can be searched using this query. If you want to translate codes from other Source Vocabularies to Standard Vocabularies use G06 query.

## Query
The following is a sample run of the query to extract details for concept code of ‘74474003’ '. Note that in contrast to concept ID the concept codes are not unique across different vocabularies.

```sql
SELECT
  c.concept_id,
  c.concept_name,
  c.concept_code,
  c.concept_class_id,
  c.vocabulary_id
FROM @vocab.concept AS c
WHERE 
  c.concept_code = $1::text AND
  c.invalid_reason IS NULL
;
```
